## How to start playing?

you will need to open up a folder called Pub.zip and run HelloWorld.exe

once you're running the game you'll get two options to create a character or load a save. If you haven't made a save then it'll start you with a new character. Just enter a name and your character will be created.

## Battle sequences

The game will start you in what I call a battle sequence which is your character facing off against an enemy.

Once you defeat an enemy you gain gold once you defeat them and proceed through the level to face off against another enemy or reach the end goal which is the shop.

## Battle sequences(Inputs)

 once you're in a Battle sequence you start first with two options.

 Option 1. press the 1 key to execute an attack against the enemy, this will end your turn and allow the enemy to have their turn.

 Option 2. press the 2 key to look through your inventory and choose between three weapons. each weapon allows you to deal more damage against an enemy but doing this will end your turn and allow the enemy to get a free hit on you.

## The Shop

the shop is the end goal for the game in which you can buy an item with the gold you earned after defeating multiple enemies. Once you enter the shop a menu will open up and will wait for your input.

once you buy something the game will end and your character will return home with what they bought.
